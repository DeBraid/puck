		<h1>FAQ</h1>

<p>
I get quite a few questions sent my way so I want to answer a few of the most frequent ones here.
<p>
<strong>I want to learn more about hockey analytics, is there somewhere that provides a good overview?</strong><br>
I wrote an <a href="https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2014/08/05/introduction-to-advanced-statistics/">Introduction to Hockey Analytics</a> for MapleLeafsHotStove.com which, and I am biased here, I think provides
the best, most complete, introduction to hockey analytics available. In it I tried to cover all the main statistics
as well as outline the pros and cons of each statistic.
<p>

<strong>Where do you get your data?</strong><br>
I get my data from the play by play, shift/TOI tables, and event summaries that are posted on NHL.com for every game. 
You can find these pages by going to a <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/boxscore.htm?id=2012020423">box score for a game at NHL.com</a> 
and clicking on the links under "Official Game Reports".
<p>


<strong>Are your stats updated automatically every night?</strong><br>
No. To update the stats I need to download the play by play, TOI tables and event summary pages to my own computer, 
run a program to update the stats, and then upload the updated stats to the web server. The process is mostly automated 
and doesn't take a lot of my time, but the program does take some time to run and updated data takes a fair bit of time
to upload to the website (WOWY tables include a lot of data). All totaled it is probably a 45 minute process so I
don't update them daily. My goal is to get them updated several times a week but offer no guarantees.
<p>

<strong>What is Corsi?</strong><br>
Corsi is a shot attempt metric and includes all shots, shots that missed the net and shots that were blocked.
<p>

<strong>What is Fenwick?</strong><br>
Fenwick, like corsi, is a shot attempt metric and includes all shots and shots that missed the net but not shots that were blocked.
<p>

<strong>What is PDO?</strong><br>
PDO is nothing more than shooting percentage + save percentage.
<p>

<strong>Should I use goal, shot, fenwick or corsi statistics?</strong><br>
This is a bit controversial. There are many who believe that the majority of a players value can be determined from shot/fenwick/corsi based
metrics but I believe goal based metrics have value as well. The main issue with goal based metrics is that goals are relatively
infrequent events as far as statistics are concerned and because of this fact it is difficult to get a large enough sample size
to be able to weed out all the randomness that occurs with them. From my research the benefits of using a goal based analysis
begins to over take the benefits of the greater sample size of shot attempts at about one full seasons worth of data. So, if
you are looking at less than a full seasons worth of data (i.e. ratings for a not yet complete season, or for a player that missed
a significant number of games due to injury, or fourth liners who don't get a significant amound of ice time) it is probably best
to consider a corsi or fenwick based rating (doesn't really matter which since both are highly correlated). If you are looking at
ratings using more than one season of data I'd definitely consider a goal based metric a better metric. At about the one full season
mark the two metrics probably have equal value so it probably doesn't matter which one you use, but I'd tend to lean towards a goal
based metric.
<p>

<strong>How do you adjust for zone starts?</strong><br>
I adjust for zone starts by ignoring the first 10 seconds after a face off in either the offensive or defensive zone. I do this
because it has been shown by both myself and others that the benefit of a zone start is almost completely negated after 10 seconds
of play and any lingering effects are too small to have a significant impact on a players overall statistics.
<p>

<strong>What does 5v5 close mean?</strong><br>
Close play is when the game is tied or within one goal in the first or second peroiods or tied in the third period.
<p>

<strong>The stats on here are different than what I see on other websites?</strong><br>
There are a few reasons that might cause this. First, because puckalytics.com is not automatically updated and generally
only updated every couple days the stats may be slightly out of date. Another reason is that some other sites don't factor out 
goalie pulled situations.  All of the 5v5 data on puckalytics.com data does not include play when when the goalie
is pulled (essentially a 6 on 5) whether in a late game or delayed penalty situations.
